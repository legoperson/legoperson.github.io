Just finish my classes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:01:46
Oh, so it must be.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:01:48
Must be time!

[Kenichi Soga] 09:01:48
It's a.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:01:50
It doesn't look up, I guess.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:01:52
No! No! So.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:01:54
So good morning, good morning, guys.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:01:57
Thank you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:01:59
Still good that we've got this reasonable time, you know, between the West Coast and Australia. So it's been.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:02:05
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:02:07
If we have time, it's gonna be a nightmare.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:09
Yeah, that's right. Morning, Dave.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:13
Hi.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:14
Good morning. Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:16
But sorry. Good afternoon to you, of course.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:18
No, no, it's okay. We can go with. Good morning. It's all good.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:23
So.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:02:23
Guy.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:23
That's pretty fun.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:24
Yeah, it is.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:24
It says.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:25
What time is it in Sydney right now?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:28
9 Am.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:29
9 A. M. Oh, not too bad!

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:31
Yeah, it's okay. It's it's a reasonable reasonable kickoff for us. So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:36
We're very

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:37
We're very. We're very happy with this. But Kenichi was just saying he just finished a whole bunch of classes, so.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:45
Might be a bit of a.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:45
Oh, yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:46
It might be time.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:46
I just finished a string of 3, meeting 3 or 4 meetings in a row.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:51
Oh, wow!

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:52
Well, I just wanted to thank you both, particularly joining us from the West Coast

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:02:53
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:02:58
For making the time up your very long day. We're coming in the start of our day, you know. So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:03:01
Pardon.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:03:04
No worries at all.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:03:05
Good to be here.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:07
Yeah, welcome and and welcome everyone from from the Australian side.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:13
And we have,

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:15
Derek from Sydney Water. We've got. Sin also has just joined us from Sydney Water.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:20
So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:22
Distinguished.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:24
Chin.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:25
And some of her team members and professor to go to from the Robotics Institute. I'm not sure if you've met Sarat before.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:03:33
Kenicho, David. So I wanted to introduce you. Think you met Fang already? You know Dame.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:03:37
Yes, yes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:03:38
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:03:39
Hello, sir!

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:03:40
Not yet.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:03:41
Hi! How are you? I'm sorry. Director of the Robotics Institute.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:03:46
But on robotics for 20 years, and with the audio it is over from 2,009.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:03:54
And what everybody's as a lesser.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:03:59
Yeah, just a brief.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:04:02
Brief, intro.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:04:03
Good to meet you.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:04:05
Very nice to meet you today.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:04:07
Both of you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:09
And I'm still admitting people. So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:12
Look, we're still in a very preliminary stage, it seems.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:16
At some point, if you might have to.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:19
Kick it off, but still getting people coming in and.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:23
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:23
These are members from

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:26
From teams across the Robotics Institute, the Data Science Institute.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:32
And maybe people also coming in from your.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:34
Yeah. Yes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:34
Teams as well.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:36
So my researchers are here.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:39
Shihan is the one who's gonna present. Then.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:04:43
Oh, good!

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:43
Take some other.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:04:45
Coming!

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:04:47
I think from East Bay mud Ing is gonna come, but she's just told me she has to head home 1st to be with her.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:04:55
5 year old, son, and then she's gonna log.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:00
Right. Thank you. Well.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:02
Anytime.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:03
She's able to. That'd be awesome if she can come, join and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:07
Certainly I'm just responding to a comment.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:11
From

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:13
From Sam, who can't get his speaker to work.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:19
You log in again. I'm just giving him some.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:21
Some advice on how? Because Sen is one of our speakers today from Sydney Water, who.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:26
Works as a colleague who works with

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:29
With damica from Sydney water, so.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:31
Trying to get your speaker to work this in.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:38
Is it? Is it the mic?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:42
Can you hear us?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:45
Yeah, you can hear us. But you got.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:49
You can't speak. That's no good.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:52
So one thing you might want to do is maybe.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:05:55
You could try and log in to log out. I know that sounds like a very Microsoft thing to do.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:00
But.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:01
But

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:03
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:05
You can also test your mic if you like, or you can just check under audio settings.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:09
Sometimes it picks up the wrong mic.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:13
Like I've got a mic that's connected to my my.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:16
My camera, and also an internal one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:19
So if you go into audio, that could be another.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:22
Way to.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:23
Detect that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:27
So I'm looking at the schedule and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:30
Sin is up first.st So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:32
We might we might have to get.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:35
We might have to change the schedule if we takes a little bit more time to fix up your mic situation.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:46
Let us know. Send if you got any improvement there.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:54
Everyone else, all the other speakers. You're.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:06:56
You're you're at the money.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:07:00
Yeah, I'm good.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:07:01
1, 2.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:07:02
Johan, do you wanna say something just in case.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 09:07:07
Yeah. Can you hear me?

[Kenichi Soga] 09:07:09
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:10
Perfectly.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:07:10
Okay.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:11
Perfectly. By the way, just housekeeping while we're still.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:15
Got people, joining.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:18
We I've just

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:21
Made the sharing of screen.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:23
Available to everyone.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:25
So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:26
So hopefully, you whoever's presenting today.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:30
Can hopefully share their screen. Without a problem.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:34
So Sam, I think, was gonna leave and then come back. I hope that he.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:38
He can get his situation to work.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:42
Kenichi what? We're 9 to 7.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:44
Did you? Wanna maybe should we kick off on? We? We send an intro at the start. To set some context.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:52
Did you want to kick off with a couple of minutes and I'll I'll be 1Â min, you know. I don't wanna.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:07:58
You know. Chat, change the schedule too much. So.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:00
All right. Yeah, thanks, Michael. Thanks everyone for joining the workshop today. This is something that we've been talking with Michael and having some.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:10
Potential great collaboration between

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:15
The Institutes in Sydney, and also organizations as well as the Institute and organization in the Bay Area, which is in San Francisco Bay Area.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:26
And we and East Bay MoD who David Katiff belongs to. We have a center call center for smart infrastructure.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:35
And it's running for about 3 years, and then we're getting San Francisco Public Utility Board, Los Angeles Department of Water.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:44
Multiple potent water district, which is these are the 4.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:49
Large water agencies.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:51
In California, and they're really supporting.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:55
Center. At the same time we work closely with Pg.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:08:59
Our.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:00
Sort of gas in power company, as well as us army call engineers, which is on the water infrastructure, size as well as catrands, which is our transportation infrastructure, like bridges and tunnels.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:14
So it's really to this particular center, for smart infrastructure is to bring innovation.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:19
To infrastructure, industry.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:21
And you'll hear from David.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:24
That. We have a great collaboration. And they're doing a lot of innovation. So.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:29
We want to work together to enhance the innovation. And that's the purpose. And hopefully, we have a little bit more collaboration.

[Kenichi Soga] 09:09:36
So that's all I wanted to say, Michael.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:40
Thank you so much. You really appreciate.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:43
Your opening statement, and I'll be.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:45
Super quick, because I want to keep the schedule, and I'm.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:49
Very much hoping that same can get his.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:52
Might work to the next stage. I'm still letting some people in while we talk.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:09:57
Following on from what Kenny was saying, it's it's my absolute pleasure.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:02
That we could come together.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:04
I'm I'm absolutely so excited that after quite a number of years I've.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:10
Kenichi, and met with David.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:11
Couple of times now. In in at Uc. Berkeley and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:16
Just really excited about what they're doing.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:19
In their smart infrastructure, space and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:22
It was a bit of a.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:24
You know. Conversation around.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:25
The work that we're doing ats, particularly you heard.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:29
Is sort of just, you know. Join this conversation, I suppose, the 1st time.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:34
Officially in in the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:36
On this zoom.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:37
As being one of the collaborators from the Robotics Institute who's been doing.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:42
Robotics, Research for water, infrastructure.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:45
From various.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:47
Applications with to new order and other utilities.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:52
And also distinguished Professor Chen.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:10:55
Who leads the Data Science Institute, who has been really complimentary with the work of team.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:01
In bringing together the data science, predictive analytics, elements.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:05
To the table on various challenges, and the title of the workshop.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:10
Is sort of what are utility challenges from the Us. To Australia.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:14
And and one of the things we tried to focus on.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:17
Was was to if.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:19
So zoom in on continuous remaining pipe. Thickness, prediction.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:22
As like a case study, but I I suppose.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:26
This is something that is a challenge on both sides. My understanding is, and I think that's part of the agenda of this workshop is to try and really.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:34
Find ways with this complementarity. Between the Us. Side and the Australian side to see

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:42
Whether we could do something together. And we have, you know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:45
You hear from Danny Kurd at some point today? During the discussion.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:50
We. He has led.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:52
Initiatives, with Sydney water, across universities, across utilities.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:57
Including with the United States.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:11:59
And and that's that was in the past. But I think what we're looking for is now.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:04
To really grow that relationship again, because.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:08
We've now got an mou between California and Australia, signed.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:12
By the highest authorities in both countries, or one State. One country instead of California is so big it's signed with a whole of Australia. And but the opportunities there are in R&D. It's they are in sustainability, decarbonization.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:27
I think water smart infrastructure water sits squarely within that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:32
We also have a sister city relationship.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:36
And the potential obviously, with David being.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:39
From Edmud and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:42
Dana and SIM, representing from Sydney Water. There's there's a real multi pronged potential which I'm so.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:48
Excited about exploring.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:49
And I really just hope that we can come to together the discussion at the end. Once we've heard the presentations.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:12:56
To really land on some ways forward. I'm so I'm really pleased that so many of you could join us this morning. So I wanna hold things up anymore. I've really gone way over my time. So I'm sorry.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:07
Thank you all for joining.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:09
On the schedule today.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:11
I might just kick it off. With the 1st speaker is

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:17
Send.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:18
And via Sir Warren, who is from Sydney Water.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:23
He is going to speak.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:25
First.st How are you going with your microphone.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:27
Michael, can you hear me?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:29
Perfectly.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:31
Oh, great!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:32
Thank you! Thank God!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:36
Because

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:13:36
Please let me know if you need it. If you need to share your screen, you should have share screen access if you need it, so I'll hand over to you.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:39
Zoom, Zoom and Sydney voter systems. They don't get long because we use Microsoft teams and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:46
I had to reinstall a couple of times, and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:50
But anyway, now I'm here, that's the most important part.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:13:55
And thank you, Michael.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:04
Yeah, that's another challenge.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:08
So do we have Damica on the call.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:14:11
That becomes.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:13
Brilliant Hi, guys.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:14:14
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:14:15
Hello!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:15
Great. I I couldn't recognize.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:19
Acronyms. Number of coming through.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:23
Alright!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:24
So

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:26
I'll I'll I'll introduce myself first.st so my name is. As Michael said. My name is same. I'm the principal manager for.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:36
Strategic asset and performance.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:40
For Sydney water.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:43
So within the Sydney water

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:47
Structure, like, you know, in our.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:49
Ways of working here.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:52
I look after the

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:14:55
The performance of the assets, and setting by understanding the performance of the assets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:00
I sit.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:02
Set the long term strategy.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:04
And now, in order for us to understand the performance of the assets, then I really need to understand where the assets are, how.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:13
Where they are in their in their life, and what we need to do to manage. Our asset portfolio, and that's the that's the challenge. And that's why, that is greater importance.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:27
To this discussion.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:29
I, I basically need to know need to know when.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:32
Which assets are going to fail. So then I can put a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:37
Program, in place.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:39
To make sure that services we we continuously provide the services. So.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:44
That's the context. I will share.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:48
The screen. Try to share the screen hopefully. It's coming.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:55
Can.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:15:56
Oh, my God!

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:16:00
Perfect. We can see a screen perfectly.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:04
Brilliant,

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:05
Again. Sorry I have been in the last 3 months. We are doing our 5 year pricing so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:12
My like, you know. I couldn't spend much time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:15
On this to polish it.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:17
But I'll I'll talk you through. The team, through the intent of where we are at and what is our problem statement, and what we would really love to do, moving forward.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:29
Now

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:30
So we are. We are only going to talk about the domains here which are quote trunk or.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:37
You know, high risk domain to the service that would be provide.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:42
Now the current status of our domains which are critical.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:46
So this is.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:48
The pipe scope. So we have about 5,200.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:53
Around 5,000 kilometers of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:16:57
Ranging from diameter and and also, from, you know, predominantly. Couple of

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:07
Major asset cohort of material cast and duck, Thailand.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:12
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:13
As as this graph. Tells us the story. When we look at those 5,000 kilometers of Watermain.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:21
It. When when these sort of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:23
Basically.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:25
The the bad chat the the dark blue line is telling when the assets are installed, as you can see from 1950.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:37
To 1970. We can say 1980.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:41
Where we had

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:43
Num. Major growth in Sydney.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:45
We have installed lot of assets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:49
What that means is.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:50
On, the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:52
On a roughly on a age profile. This is just, you know, very simple.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:17:56
Not not complicating with with any of the any of our predicted life, and things like that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:03
But where we are standing now in 2020.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:08
More than around 50 of the asset I have.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:11
Past 50 life, and this is not.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:16
These are like, these are.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:17
Major high risk assets for us to enable the service continuity.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:24
When we talk to exec, and that's and as we move forward to secure funding with increasing you know, inflation and cost of living pressures and things like that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:36
We won't be able to replace these assets as we

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:39
You know, as we get age, or as we.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:44
As the as these pipes get older and deteriorate, we won't be able to replace this level of

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:52
Moving forward. So that's the problem statement. So we need to be.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:56
Really understanding? Where in our.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:18:59
Where these assets are.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:01
In the end of service.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:03
So then we can.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:04
Target, a replacement.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:07
Now with that challenge. What we got.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:11
And then the next step. What we do is we mesh up how our assets so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:18
We use a simple

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:23
Mechanism, you know, when we talk about asset performance, we we look into 2 ways. One.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:30
Is assets are failing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:32
The.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:33
Breakdown failures so like.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:35
In the area of operations. The orange.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:40
Orange line, the top, which tells us.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:43
The breakdown.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:44
Maintenance, Fail.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:46
How we are going on an annual basis, as you can see here.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:51
For this particular asset cohort, breakdown maintenance, or used to hold that as a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:19:57
You know, assets which are failing 1st time. Which we don't know which we have. We don't have a history of failures.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:04
How that is tracking over the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:06
Over the last 5 years. This is we. We used to report to the board. And.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:14
To really understand the performance of the asset. And I I must note here our performance of the assets are.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:21
Really influenced by the weather and the climate as well. That's what you're seeing here in the background that that you know, rainfall data in the background. Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:34
In the live blue line which is at the bottom. It's telling us the repeat failure. These are repeat failures which we know.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:43
In the past, so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:45
Now, the where we really focus on to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:49
Really eliminate the repeat failure because we had, which we had the opportunity to assess. What is the failure.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:20:55
And you know where we really don't want these to go.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:01
Unmanageable

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:03
Place.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:05
And and then the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:06
And the middle middle line. It's telling us, basically.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:11
What is the asset performance? So the asset performance. So we call here in Sydney. What are we? We have a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:17
Indicator called asset performance, which is a combination of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:21
Assets fail, 1st time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:24
And the assets fail repeatedly.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:25
And it it's a it's an inde. It's an index. It's been measured across the asset class.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:31
For us to understand where we are.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:33
Where we are at in our performance. Improvement path.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:37
But.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:39
In essence. It's it's a failure.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:43
Of the asset is what we measure here.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:46
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:49
With with this data.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:50
We we now have.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:52
You know, which we have about last 15 years of data which we now know.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:21:56
Where where the assets are at the Asset cohort level. I'm I'm still not talking at the asset level.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:03
But the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:05
As a cohort level. As I said, I am from a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:08
From my asset custodian team to look after the strategy and the performance. So we we.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:14
We look at this to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:16
To talk through. What are the funding.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:20
Now then, we have our, you know, deterioration.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:25
So this is the asset cohortiation curve. For us to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:30
At this point of time where we are moving now at the Asset cohort level. When we talk about, you know, hydrants and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:39
As I said previously, what domains? We have more.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:43
Steel main, or cast iron or duct line, and then the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:46
Fully clean, and PVC.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:48
Latest newcomers into the

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:51
Name to the asset, portfolio.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:22:53
And then, and we have water structured and water valve as well. So this is what we currently use. So for customer. Next.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:03
15 to 30 Investment Plan.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:06
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:07
Because you know, as you know, how business works is which we we can't react.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:13
Once the assets fail. We. We need to plan our business over a 15 year.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:19
Period, so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:21
This is. This is what we call as a cohort level curve.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:25
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:26
Where we really wanted to move from here to next level understanding.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:32
The.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:34
Individual, asset.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:35
Failure. So this, this gives us.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:38
The the very high level way to focus which which areas to focus.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:42
From. There is what now? Work thats and Damica.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:49
Did over the last 2 to 3 years is where we are advancing through to get.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:56
Just in time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:57
Failure.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:23:57
So so then we can we we can get closer to the failures as we move forward. Now again.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:07
That we can jump in here, this is basically, I'm not.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:13
You know I'm not. This is not new, for.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:16
People in this call. This is some of the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:20
As I said, our main failure, mechanism.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:24
Sorry. Our main asset cohort is acosta and duct tile.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:28
And this is some example of how yes, it's fail.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:35
And and where where we are moving forward, is to really.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:40
Identification and fixing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:45
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:24:47
Tamika, you understand? Do you want to talk? The next 2 slides.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:24:52
Alright, so.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:24:54
The ability to, I think very quickly, to predict performance.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:00
Based on.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:01
Citywater has.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:02
I'm going to say this the best.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:05
Failure records for nearly 20 years.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:08
Because right?

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:09
In the in the right in the beginning, 20 years ago, and this has made.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:13
Us.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:15
Easier for us to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:17
Use that data to predict performance.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:19
So this is about predicting performance.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:23
In in a way that could drive.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:25
Some of the things that Cindy saying.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:27
The remaining life, as well as to prevent high consequence.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:31
So this.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:32
Approach, together with the.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:35
Ability to look inside continuously. The remaining whole thickness.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:40
We're not at a commercial level on that measurement.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:43
But definitely, we had a commercial level or the ability to predict performance. We are with the strengthening that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:50
Has been brought by.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:52
Through the business lens through the asset lens.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:55
Which I think people tend to forget in.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:25:59
Universities and researchers tend to forget that we're talking of the key assets that are delivering.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:26:06
Custom experience to our customers. So that's all I would say.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:26:10
And we cannot go into the question session later.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:15
Yeah, and then.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:17
And if you can talk to this as well. You're close to this.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:26
Then we can.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:32
You're on mute if you're talking.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:42
I don't know what. So so basically, it's from there over the last 5 years. So we we partnered with

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:52
With uts to really understand.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:56
Which, where.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:26:58
Where we are closing in those failures.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:01
Sorry I was not able to unmute myself. Alright.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:04
So.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:06
What are the learnings over the last.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:09
15 years.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:11
Through this collaboration across the board industry.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:14
With United States, UK.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:19
Out of Europe.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:20
And ourselves.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:22
Was basically to understand that the corrosion.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:26
Occurs in patches.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:26
And we have proven this with the.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:29
Ability that we had with the measurements that we did.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:32
With the robotics. We have proven that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:35
Basically only 5% of our pipes have this level of corrosion.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:39
Maybe, with the remaining live calculation, 20 to 30.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:44
You know, targeted renewals right now.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:47
70% is still good.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:48
And we need to assess, how long will that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:52
Remaining, life.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:27:53
Work. So we have the tools. We have the capability. We have to know how we just need to translate this into a asset performance index, which is what send is trying to do. It's not easy, because.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:05
This part.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:07
However it may have taken 15 years.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:09
Changing the culture of the organization.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:12
We need to do it more rapidly. It is a significant challenge.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:16
That's.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:28:17
That's that's all.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:19
Yeah, so this is, this is again, some of the examples of you know how we have identified at the localized level.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:28
Some of the failures. But the challenge that what we have, I'll I'll I'm just mindful of time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:34
I'll I'll share this presentation after.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:37
This goes through how we have identified and things like that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:41
Now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:43
The the real challenge. What we, what we got is this table here so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:48
Now at the business level.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:49
It's all well and good for for us to identify the assets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:56
Particular Assets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:28:58
For example.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:00
Now, when we translate that into a business terms,

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:07
Whether that 50, you know, 50% of the assets are have aged more than 50 year old. What does that mean?

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:15
Do a feature, sustainable position of the business.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:18
How much budget, how much money we need.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:21
To spend over the next 20 to 30 to 50 years.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:25
That's that's 1 question.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:27
And the second question coming from.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:31
From this table here, which is which is listing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:34
The asset scope against that critical means. I'll I'll take one example of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:41
Where we are currently on the go to main cast time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:45
Some inline pipe. We have 2,787.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:49
At this point of time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:51
Based on.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:52
Yes, a cohort deterioration. We talk about 92.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:59
East, of a life.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:29:59
That's that, said the asset. Cohort.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:01
Just for for a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:03
15 year, budgeting investment perspective.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:07
Now the challenge here is.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:08
We have already. So this is when we talk about hype of very hype, of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:14
Which is a high probability of failure.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:16
And the very high probability of failure. Now this is as of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:20
As of financially a 24 as of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:23
This year.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:25
Now the challenges we have, we know, around 76 kilometer of assets which are.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:32
Very high.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:34
Very high probability of failure.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:37
Now it is not an easy task to fund and replace the 76 kilometers of assets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:43
4.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:45
To placement in one year.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:46
We, we can only fund and replace around.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:50
You know, 15% of this is, it's for around 10 kilometer per annual renewals.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:57
So.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:30:58
That's where we need help. That's what is. Now we are partnering with Uds to to really understand out of these 76 kilometer how much we need to replace.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:11
Cause, you know, as you know, they they are buried, and they're just. It's not easy to get. And there's a quick market condition. So we just need to get closer and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:20
And closer.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:21
For us to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:23
Target them when they get there on Site.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:25
They're replacing. Rather, they're not replacing assets which we don't want to replace, because our curve is going up so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:32
That is a challenge which we have. We, as Dom said we, we we are in the process of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:42
Making it our ways of working as business as usual, moving away from.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:48
The

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:51
This, you know, piloting this trialing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:31:53
This problem is real. And and where we where we are focusing is to get that more.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:32:00
Make it make it as bu to target 15% of that 76 kilometer for renewal every year.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:32:07
So that's.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:32:09
That's basically it's our journey when it comes to prediction of assets and and the remaining life.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:32:17
Where we are at so far in Sydney border.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:32:20
Open for any questions.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:32:24
Thank you very much. Given our timing, we could take one burning question. If someone has it.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:32:31
But we might leave some of the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:32:33
Longer discussion towards the end. Anyone have.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:32:36
Major burning question. Thank you again for presenting. That was great.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:32:42
David. You've unmuted.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:32:44
Yeah, send San Domica. You. You're speaking my language. 100.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:32:49
I will tell you that.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:32:51
In terms of the challenges that that we both have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:32:56
It would. The one question I did have it looked like conditioned tools were all.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:02
In like big enough to get inside of a big pipe. Is that right?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:06
Yeah, yeah, I mean, it seems like the data you've collected. You're putting. You're putting some robotics inside the pipe.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:13
Yes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:14
Yeah.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:14
I think, for we have we have some size limitation which now we can know exactly. But yes.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:19
Mostly.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:21
You haven't tried.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:22
These are trunk mains. By the way.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:23
These are trunk mains. Okay? Oh, so all of your kilometers here are just for your trunk mains. You're not including your.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:26
Mostly.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:33
Route.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:33
Say, distribution means.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:34
No, no, so distribution means around 18,000 kilometers, which is not in this

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:40
On! On!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:42
That, you know we are not that sorry? I don't want to say we are not that worried, but the the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:33:47
We haven't included. Distribution means in this analysis. This is mostly trunk.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:52
Okay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:54
Okay. Well, I think that's probably one difference between the work that I'm doing. And.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:33:59
And you're doing. Since you're focused on the trunkmains.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:02
My work is all focused on. The distribution means that I'm gonna talk about.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:05
But.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:08
I, it's still the same.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:10
It really the bigger challenge of, you know, kind of.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:12
What pipe to replace.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:14
How do you spend your money wisely, and how much you're gonna do in the future? That is all the big. This is the same thing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:34:17
Yes.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:34:19
Nice.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:21
Yeah.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:34:22
Exactly. That's the exact question. That's the question that comes from my general manager.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:34:26
Each time. When I talk about this, what is the business benefit? What is the business value.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:28
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:31
Right.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:31
Right? So we have that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:32
So I think, David, just making that point.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:36
We have done some work now on the distribution also, and.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:41
We're good doing some work right now in the next couple of.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:44
Sort of, yeah.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:46
Oh, 10 months!

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:48
On using gravity, sensing to look at.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:51
Wet this around pipes.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:52
So, which means that without into the pipe we are looking.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:34:57
The the condition around the pipe. So it's quite important that distribution. You're right, because for the customer.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:34:59
Right.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:03
It is a matter whether it's a distribution or whether it's.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:07
Whether it's the

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:10
Larger. Pip.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:11
It's important that we really focus about.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:15
Current issue that send as is.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:16
We need to prioritize our resources in a way that we target.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:21
The bigger picture.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:22
Rather than you know, do going and putting resources everywhere.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 09:35:26
Alright. Thank you.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:28
Well, and maybe that's where that's a nice collaboration between Sydney Water and East Bay mud.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:33
Since you're focused more on your.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:35
Trunk lines. I'm focused more on our distribution.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:35:39
Absolutely.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:39
Blend the 2 together. Yeah.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:35:41
Absolutely.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:42
Am I next.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:35:46
Sorry I was muted.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:47
No.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:35:47
You don't.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:35:48
I've just put up the schedule just to keep everyone on task.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:35:51
So sorry for the confusion. The schedule that was circulated.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:35:57
Am I still? Can you hear me?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:35:58
Yes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:35:59
Yeah, sorry. So this is.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:36:02
The schedule that it was circulated. I've transcribed into the calendar, invite.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:36:08
I don't know if you can see it, but it's after Sydney Water. We've got uts. And then yourself, David, that's okay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:36:13
Okay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:36:14
Okay.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:36:14
So I might. I just wanted to put up the schedule as a reminder, and hopefully you can see that. But.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:36:20
It's it's slightly changed in the order. So fain. And Seraph, our respective directors of the Data Science Institute and the Robotics Institute will present together.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:36:32
So I'd like to hand over to them to carry on the discussion.

[Fang Chen] 09:36:38
Thanks everyone, Saras, you want to share the slides.

[Fang Chen] 09:36:42
Yeah. So why Saras, sharing the slides.

[Fang Chen] 09:36:47
The All. The presentation we put up together now today is focus on critical main trunk men. But having said that the same methodology, not the condition assessment, just the looking at the data prediction. That part we've done for city water, distribution main as well. And then.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:09
Action result is better than better than trunk men, for the reason of the data in distribute distribution names are a lot more.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:19
So then the trunkman.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:21
Into particular. The incident, or, you know, break the leak and break data. So those ones serve as a ground truth for predictions.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:31
So let me quickly go through some predictive analysis, for critical water mains.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:39
So I don't need you to introduce myself.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:43
So this one is.

[Fang Chen] 09:37:47
Sort of like a summary of how singing waters work process. Sorry I took a bit because we need to understand the ways, the improvement that we actually try to target into.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:01
Of course we all know that to the patch repair with a fit for purpose is required.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:09
I mean to fit these 76 kilometer target. There.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:15
And the way we're looking to is.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:18
At 1st we try to get a horizon view of overarching.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:25
The fighter prediction together with the consequence model, which is, you know, the the cost of a repair and the cost the cost of the the break.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:35
To.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:36
You know, to economy in general, including repair, including other cost, could be the the trend transport, disturbance and flooding all those ones.

[Fang Chen] 09:38:48
And

[Fang Chen] 09:38:51
Gets a soil and other information together to the 1st round of assessment is is a part of that assessment, and eventually we will, using the more detailed condition assessment into level 3.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:09
Oh, sorry. Yeah. On the bottom one is a level 3 condition assessment which the insertion tool, or whatever tools which will be applicable.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:22
Next one, please.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:23
Yeah, so.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:24
The this one looks very, very busy.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:28
But what we we try to look into is that complicated and comprehensive.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:34
Collaboration between universities and utility, which is a city water. For this case, which you can see, we have a starting, have a top.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:47
Prediction model, which is a predicted sorry

[Fang Chen] 09:39:52
Created it by my team.

[Fang Chen] 09:39:53
And some of the team members here and then combine with the city waters model, which is the economic model. And to do the 1st Level assessment.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:02
And do we get a bit sampling or detail, and fitting into a more prioritize the selection.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:11
And then getting to the more detailed exercise, including condition assessment, and to eventually recommend the newer program.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:24
Next one, please.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:25
So from predictive side, there's plenty of predictive tool has been generated in past more than decade.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:34
And look into.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:36
The.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:37
And.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:38
Every element that we can collect, the data around the pipes, including the pipe attributes and the past, the work, order, history, and to some of the you know.

[Fang Chen] 09:40:53
You know. You see, the top left is is on the Gis. Topology view as a topology.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:02
Information, and some of them we even use the tree coverage canopy. So all those information that we can count in.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:12
And for leak, we actually use the minimum, which is a right-hand bottom in order to create overarching assessment of the entire network pipe conditions.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:26
Next one, please.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:27
So in sense, presentation already, I mean, show to this one, and we haven't explained in detail. This is the.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:36
Showed the close collaboration between University and the city water is, we're actually looking to.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:43
Every year.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:44
This only show the summer years we actually looked at since 2,010, and every year look at our predictions versus actually, what's what's happened on the ground.

[Fang Chen] 09:41:54
And utilizing those as to build a confidence of what the tools can do.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:00
And then.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:01
What and how we learn from each of the incidents from the network.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:08
So by I mean, I want to explain so much detail. But even looking into the bottom.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:15
Bottom, right.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:18
Figure which is shows like, if we talk about a 20%.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:23
A top. 20% risky type, we predicted, is actually in 3, 24, financial year covered almost 90% of those.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:34
Of the the actual failure happen.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:35
So that means.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:37
The.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:38
I mean ideal case. If we eventually targeting 20 of the failure covered. Of course, 20% is a big dream. I know at the moment. Probably we drive towards 2% 2.5.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:53
And then.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:54
But.

[Fang Chen] 09:42:56
He's a he's a as I said. He's a working in progress, however, with better targeting that will get our target or city water overall wanted.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:08
So next one, please, yeah.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:11
I want to bring this one in.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:14
This is actually last 30 years of data plot in terms of feature importance. This is not a Bible, however, this shows.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:22
Data some of the key influences towards, I mean, at least, we call correlation, right from data perspective. Look at what features actually important. I'm not saying all those ones absolutely the top.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:37
Pop, course of the failure, but that help us.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:43
To pick. What kind of prediction methods and predicting.

[Fang Chen] 09:43:50
So some of them is no brainer. For example, the late years, for example, the material, all those ones and some of the long tail one. A lot of them is the details. For example, the soil attributes has been, divided into different attributes. Those ones can be combined when we do actually, prediction, etc. So there's a.

[Fang Chen] 09:44:14
As a lot of techniques can play.

[Fang Chen] 09:44:16
The most important one, I guess.

[Fang Chen] 09:44:20
What I try to champion here is number one is using data and then predictable analytics to sit as a guideline. So strategic oversight of those ones, and then pick the best a target as much as possible. Hence that the money.

[Fang Chen] 09:44:38
We use probably the best of targeted.

[Fang Chen] 09:44:42
So. And yeah, the the last one is is, of course, that's final selection. Never escape this consequence. One is some some pipes may be the.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:00
The.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:02
2 sorry. The possibility or probability of failure is not at the top, but the consequence is very high, and those ones still will be

[Fang Chen] 09:45:13
In the in the list to be considered.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:15
So the consequence. School.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:18
If you look at the chart, which is that we have a top 100 pipes.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:24
primarily focus on CIO, because there's a the large portion, and also, with consequence, scores more than you know. 3, 4 5, you have a can. Look into different color orders. And with those one also geographically presented there, give a better idea in terms. If you want to look into.

[Fang Chen] 09:45:47
Few of the inspections, renewers, condition, assessment whatever in the patch or in a batch mode that can provide some insight as well.

[Fang Chen] 09:46:00
Okay. We'll just.

[Fang Chen] 09:46:03
Passed to Sarah, talking to more details about.

[Fang Chen] 09:46:07
He's.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:10
Thanks. Fang. Yeah, I'm going to give a very high level and

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:18
How it has been used in this measuring of current condition of the pipes.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:24
1st of all, there are 2 major challenges. When we look at those assets, how we want to.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:31
Use recordings to get measurement. The 1st one comes to.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:37
Is the sensing what sort of sensors are suitable for this? In order to measure what is the quantity that is.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:44
Required. So that's done. We can send mentioned

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:47
Pets. Corrosion in.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:50
Cast iron pipes were identified as one of the major drivers of the.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:55
Birth, therefore.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:46:56
A sense in technology which can measure that is.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:00
Technology that we are going to use. So what we have been using is

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:05
Plus recurrent.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:06
The.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:08
It's. It's not a complicated. It is a simple one which has 2 coils, one basically.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:15
Ignite a magnetic field it goes through when it comes to a.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:20
Metallic, ferromagnetic, material.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:23
There are any current form that Eddie currents.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:27
Once you switch off the ignition that Eddie current producer.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:32
A secondary

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:34
Magnetic field. That is the one that we are going to mention.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:37
So based on analysis of how it decays.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:41
We can estimate what is the thickness of the ferromagnetic material.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:46
As you can imagine. When the corrosion happens, the ferromagnetic becomes magnetic.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:52
Because of the corrosion.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:54
Then only measuring that Ferromagnet part.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:47:56
So that's the principle. And once we have that we have to.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:02
Interpret the thickness. So that is done through machine learning.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:05
Method, we have training data using some samples.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:09
And then use that.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:11
With.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:12
Other information that we have.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:16
In clean the signal. There are many

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:20
Noises you can imagine, because of all.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:23
Magnetic based motors and others around it, and electronic. So we filter that and then predict, what is the thickness.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:33
So that is the kind of sensing in a very broader sense.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:39
This is just not only the critical means. I just put this slide in order to showcase that you know there are. The products can go in many different.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:51
Types of pipes as well.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:48:54
And all of them is working with Sydney water. So the very 1st one is the very large trunk mains for 50 to 7, 50.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:03
The the black parts are the ones which are based on pulse city current. So pick sensors around it.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:11
The main thing is, once you insert into a pipe, it need to fit into the diameter.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:18
This assignment, Karstan. So you had to really compensate for that thickness of the cement line as well. So based on the diamet of the pipe. This expands.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:31
And moves while taking the measurement.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:34
So.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:35
And at the same time there are 2 ways of dealing with that. One is, you know, you because, as you can imagine, when this expanded, there are gaps going to be.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:45
Form it in between the 2 senses. So what you can do is turn a bit and then move again. Right? So in that way you can. Complete the picture.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:49:55
This also has many other senses on board. It has the capability to 3 dimensional remap.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:01
What is.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:03
Pipe looks like, and then it shows.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:07
Continuously along the pipe. What is the thickness? What we call is a thickness map.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:13
So medium pipes have bins and therefore this particular design need to accommodate.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:22
To navigate Ben's.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:24
In this way. How we achieve that is, we have the crawler and the sensing.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:29
Is detached to that, so that there is a flexible joint in between that.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:33
So that it can easily navigate the bill.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:36
Sensing is the same.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:40
Only the difference is that it is now with the smaller form factor, and also it is the second one is more waterproof. So.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:48
The 1st one there are 2 applications. That is the large pipes. City. What I wanted us to focus on one is main.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:50:58
Basically when a break happens,

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:01
It is.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:03
And you know we don't know at what time it is going to happen. But mostly what our team was saying is that it is happening, and.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:10
Early in the morning, like 3 Am. 2 am. Sort of a time. So when that happens, the idea is that the city water calls.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:19
Give a call to one of our team members.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:22
And the robot is ready. We call them pipe doctors.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:25
They go there and deploy that in in that

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:30
Opening, digging at this and opportunistic opening.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:34
The other part is planned. Maintenance water uses inform the customers, and set up a date and a time.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:41
And then use that.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:43
So the medium pipes is meant for plan maintenance, and then the main another work that

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:53
To devote us to focus on is.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:55
In these 1st 2.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:51:58
Robotics, types, the.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:01
Pipe need to be devoted. It's okay to have a little bit of puddles there, but it need to be devoted. It's not going to be operational.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:08
But the last one at the corner is a design in such a way that it can be inserted while the PC.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:17
It could be.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:19
Extremely important to.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:23
Target or work with what Zen was saying before. How could you really, you know, do this inspection? So without.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:30
Disturbing the customers day to day life, or interrupting their.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:36
Water flow.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:37
So this is based on the in. This is the inception part of it. So it is. In session. 2 available system.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:46
It need to be fixed into that.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:48
And then once you.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:52
At the beginning you.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:53
Plus both vales, and then you open the top valve inside the tool.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:52:59
Close the top well.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:01
Open the bottom well, and then it can go through that. One of the main things is that.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:07
We can't have the luxury of having so many batteries in there because of the obvious reason. This is water pipes.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:14
Therefore.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:16
It is minimized, and it has a kind of a parachute opening up when it goes in. There.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:23
And once that parachute order umbrella opens up, the water, flow, drives the.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:29
At the same time the.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:31
Sensing.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:32
Is going to be expanded, and it can touch the awards in such a way that it can take measurements.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:39
So that is the concept.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:42
Concept! And this has been tested in many times now and.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:47
This has to be high pressure resistance, because we are talking about very high pressure.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:53:53
So these are some of the deployments. I'm not taking too much time, but I thought of just giving that. I have 1Â min. It looks like Michael was saying.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:03
This is just to showcase that this is not only lab systems which are, you know,

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:10
Working on simulations or working on lab setup.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:17
Deployed in the, in the fields. There are challenges as we go with learning, but it is incremental.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:25
Development that we do. So. This is one of the deployments. How it's the robots is done, and this is what I call thickness. Map.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:33
Based on this. This color is mapped, based on that. It can tell.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:36
Oh, might the thickness, visually as well as it has a value.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:41
So 5 me millimeters, so 10 or so on, and so forth.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:46
This is for another ones. I just wanted to. As a completion. Just wanted to mention. This is for me. The it is again cement and cement.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:54:58
We have developed these techniques which goes inside that and measure the thicknesses of the pipes again, these have been

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:08
Deployed in many sites.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:11
And again, this is another type which is gravity, which is not cast, and it is concrete which has a reinforcement. What you get is something like that. So it is 3 dimensional. Reconstruct what is in there as well as it maps where the reinforcement pass.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:32
One of the major innovations that we did was we could tell how much is soft concrete, which is the.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:40
Corroded part of the complete.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:42
And what is the good part of the concrete left to the reinforcement.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:47
Without having to take samples.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:49
So that's I will finish it off. There, I think there's a discussion coming later. I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 09:55:58
Thanks.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:00
Thank you so much, and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:02
And fang. Excellent.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:04
Real. I know you had a bit of a challenge to try and fit it in one slot. So I really appreciate you doing that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:10
Any other questions?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:13
Well, maybe any burning questions. I know we're sort of running a little bit over schedule, and I'm.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:19
You know, mindful of people's time.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:20
We do have the discussion at the end. But are there any burning questions from anyone?

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:24
One question.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:26
30 seconds.

[Michael Blumenstein] 09:56:31
Shall we leave it to the discussion.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:33
We're you know. I was.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:35
Questioning thing, your pre presentation you had. I really liked your your chart.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:41
Where you had all the bars where you had factors that were.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:45
Pressure seemed to be.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:48
Maybe not.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:49
As big a factor as as I would think.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:56:53
It was that surprising to you.

[Fang Chen] 09:56:56
It's not. It's not as surprising to me, because this is also complicated. One.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:02
Is the pressure so like a for example, water gone gone through? Probably all the utilities gone through, different iterations in terms of our management.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:57:11
Yeah.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:12
So.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:13
The some pressure reduction whatever. So those ones they have

[Fang Chen] 09:57:21
Hard to say, confused, that parameter.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:57:23
Yeah.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:23
So it's not consistent. But if this is all 30 years average right?

[Fang Chen] 09:57:28
So. But if we look into, if a a chose, different suburbs and different years.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:57:29
Right.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:37
Though the.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:38
The.

[Fang Chen] 09:57:40
The importance of the pressure probably will jump.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:57:45
Right.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:57:46
Right.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:57:46
Hunt.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:57:47
There is just a.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:57:49
A few words here, so besides that, you can also see that there are like a.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:57:56
As a fact, has actually quite related, like those.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:01
Quantile Level.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:02
Based the factors. So I also relate to the pressure. So what we consider.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:10
You can see that I should not only the projector itself, but also like a level, mean level, whereas all those sectors are actually.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:20
Also related to to.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:22
To, the.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:26
So overall, you can see like it's it's just very, very similar to those. When we analyzing the 4 factors, the so factor has been like a divided into like a.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:37
Guidelines off like a different small factors, and also like for the ground level and pressure. There are also quite a few factors actually related to that.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:46
So when we consider the overall impact.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:49
Maybe was. Why, if we summarize all those different.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:52
Related factors.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:58:54
I see.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:58:55
Yeah, thank, you.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:58:56
One of the one of the metrics that we always.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:01
Used to describe our our systems in terms of the health.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:05
Is main breaks per 100 miles per year. Well, I mean we have miles, but is that the same? Do you use the same similar type of metric. Yeah.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:59:16
True. It's everyone like political what I mean. Usually it's like from 10 to 20, something

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:59:25
Number of failures per year per 100 kilometers.

[UTS&NBN&CSIRO NBN Demand Forecast] 09:59:28
That's the metric.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:30
So there's a national metric we use for like.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:34
Comparing the benchmarking of national

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:36
You know other utilities within Australia as well.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:39
Right.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:39
That's that's the only metric we've been using consistently over the last 20 years.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:43
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:44
Cause. That's what we use, too.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:45
But it's a lag indicator. It's a lag indicator. So we need to move forward with the future.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:47
Yeah.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:51
More lead indicator. This is where this all comes into.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 09:59:55
Into the picture. The asset Health focused.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:56
I see.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:58
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 09:59:59
Definitely.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:02
Okay, this has been really a great discussion between between presentation. Sometimes it's good to have that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:10
You know, while the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:11
Ideas, fresh.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:13
David,

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:15
I would like you to.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:17
I jumped in.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:19
And sharing.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:19
Great you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:00:20
I appreciate that you're cognizant of our time schedule. Thank you so much.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:26
Okay. Alright. Good. Well, it's good to be here with you all.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:30
My name is David Katz. I'm the manager of the Pipeline construction group.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:36
Here at East Bay mud. We do all of our.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:39
All of our construction in house with our own staff, with our own crews.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:45
We actually also do paving restoration with our own crews.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:51
I used to work in the engineering.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:54
In the engineering side, doing all the planning.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:00:56
And the design so very, very familiar with the risk, modeling, risk analysis, looking at all the factors.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:04
And and looking at our system. But I've recently moved over into construction, but I also have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:09
I don't know. Ang, are you here?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:11
Online. I can't see everybody.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:17
No

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:18
Ang is a senior civil engineer. She's working on the engineering side.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:23
And she. She is quite familiar, too, with the data and the selection process and everything. So the 2 of us.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:29
We're gonna kind of give an overview.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:32
Of of what we do here at Eastbay. So pipeline, rebuild.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:35
Is is the program. So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:38
Let me give you some data, and I'll try to move through things pretty quickly.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:43
But this I don't sorry, for. There's no text.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:46
But this is San Francisco. Right here Golden Gate Bridge. The Shihung has this in his background, so that Golden Gate Bridge.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:54
Right here.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:01:56
Treasure Island, and then if you cross the bridge here, it's called the Bay Bridge.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:03
It collapsed in the night. Well, part of it collapsed when we had an earthquake in 1,989.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:11
You cross the bridge here you get to the East Bay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:14
And so this is our entire network.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:18
Of pipes in the East Bay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:22
Roughly 4,000 miles.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:25
Of of pipes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:27
The you can see the breakdown of the different materials, the cast iron asbestos, met steel and PVC, so we have a mix of everything.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:37
And then what's not shown here on this this graph.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:42
Is the fact that we have a hay. The Hayward fault.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:45
If I just trace. You know the arrow, my mouse, across there.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:49
We have a major fault that runs right through our system.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:53
That's due for for we are due for an earthquake at any time. Really.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:02:59
It's been. It's been over a hundred years since we've had a major earthquake on the Hayward fault.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:04
So clearly. You know, we live in a very seismic area.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:11
Since we have the.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:12
Here. This is the San Francisco Bay.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:15
We have soils all along the bay with risk of lipfaction.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:20
And then we have actually the hills here. You don't see any pipes up here, because those are the hills. That which divide one part of our service area and the other.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:31
We have the high risk of landslide.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:34
Up there as well with the with the soils.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:37
So we have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:38
Default. We have landslides, we have liquefaction.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:43
So those are.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:45
Geologically, those are some challenges that we have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:51
Now we you Sydney Water, you you guys have started in the 1950 s, we go back to the 18 hundreds.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:03:59
With our pipe. So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:01
Here's our decade. Late 18 hundreds.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:05
The cast iron pipe, the green.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:07
And you know the buildup right here. Then we started putting in the asbestos.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:12
Which is the purple.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:14
Right here in the fifties to the eighties.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:16
We also transition to steel at that time, and then we started to do some more plastic.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:23
Towards the end, so that that kind of breaks down.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:26
You know how we built up our system and the materials.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:30
This is our problem.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:32
Which I think is similar to to what you're talking about.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:36
Not every main break is looks like this.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:40
But clearly the main breaks the water loss, and reducing this is.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:46
Is really our overarching.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:48
Goal is to re is to reduce all that.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:51
When you look, when you start to get into our data with our pipe materials.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:04:57
The cast iron here, the orange. This is the metric I was talking about. The main breaks for 100 miles per year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:03
The cast iron is clearly our worst.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:06
Our our worst pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:08
Breaking it, you know, over 50.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:11
Breaks per 100 miles per year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:14
Up here, and still trending, still trending up.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:17
Next is our asbestos pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:21
You know, we're at about 23.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:24
Breaks per 100 miles per year with the asbestos.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:28
Kind of the big unknown for us right now we we have over a thousand miles of it.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:36
Right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:38
What's this number gonna do?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:40
Is it? Gonna get up to the 50 mark where the cast iron is.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:44
Is it gonna kind of remain stable right there into the future?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:49
That's 1 of our biggest questions right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:53
That that we don't have answers to.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:56
That.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:05:57
I think condition assessment can help us with.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:02
The the the red. Here is our steel pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:05
Even though it kind of looks flat here in terms of a break.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:10
We're starting to see more.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:11
More breaks on our steel pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:14
So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:15
You know we're focused on our cast iron a little bit on our A/C.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:19
But steel is also kind of.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:22
You know, on the on this, on the sideline, to kind of jump into the game.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:30
So that's that's our break rates right there for a system. If we look a little bit more into depth, into the cast iron pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:37
This is so. This is just cast iron pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:40
The blue.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:43
Marks. You know how much.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:44
In terms of miles. How many was installed.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:48
In each year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:49
Look at our break rate of the cast iron. The the gray line is our break.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:54
The the pipe that was installed in the 30 s. And the 40 s. Right in here.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:06:58
That's our worst pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:00
Pipe that was installed in the late 18 hundreds and early 19 hundreds.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:05
Much lower break rate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:08
Per mile.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:10
So. And this this is not surprising.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:13
Because the wealthiest.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:15
Of the pipe in the thirties and forties.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:18
Much less than the wall thickness. Early on.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:22
So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:23
You know, we're talking about condition, assessment, wealth.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:26
It's extremely important.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:28
In terms of break rates.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:30
Here's the Rebuild Mission.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:33
I'll try to run quickly through this, you know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:36
Of course, ramping up to a long term sustainable rate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:41
Is is our primary goal.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:43
And what is that?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:44
How many crews do we add?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:46
How many miles of pipe do we replace per year?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:49
How long does that last? 1020 years?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:53
It's very, very costly.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:55
And so these are massive.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:07:58
Questions and big challenges that we have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:00
And we don't have answers to those right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:04
And then we, you know, we do this all through teamwork and innovation.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:09
Really, the innovation is where we've got linked up with Uc. Berkeley and Kenichi and all of his team in developing the center for smart infrastructure.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:20
You know, overall with the rebuild. We, you know, we look to, you know, identify improvements.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:26
We do a lot of piloting to to find different ways of doing things.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:32
We evaluate. We have really well defined metrics.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:35
And then, once we find something that works, we scale up.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:40
Lot of different things that we think about.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:43
In terms of in our planning design, and as built in. These, are all the kind of things that that we think about.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:51
In terms of streamlining and becoming more cost effective.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:56
In doing our work.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:08:58
You know, in May 2016.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:01
We started this whole ramp.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:03
So we hired new staff. We actually started traveling around utilities.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:08
We went to Denver Water we went to Los Angeles.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:10
I've been to Portland Water. I've been to Boston water.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:14
Talk to people in Chicago.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:16
Talk to people at Washington. Suburban.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:18
I've always found that, like talking to other utilities about these common challenges that we all have.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:25
Is is where I do my best. Learning.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:28
We're in internally here, where we do our best learning.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:30
And where we can kind of push forward.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:33
With with pilots. Here's a picture of us.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:36
Talking with people from Denver Water.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:38
So you know, over the course of the years we've we've tried a number of different things.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:44
To to gain efficiencies, be more cost, effective and streamlined.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:50
With with different staffs, with, you know, different equipment, different crew, configurations.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:09:56
We look at different pipe materials.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:00
Different types of PVC and duck iron.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:04
You know, we look at different things to do out on the construction site with with different trailers for ours.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:10
We tried trenchless renewal with.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:12
With aqua pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:15
You know, Overall, we've these are pictures of our crews. There.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:20
We've actually added 73 new positions.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:23
That that that number actually is low, it it should be more in the eighties.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:28
Cause we've gone up to 13 pipeline crews.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:31
And now we're actually at 25 miles per year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:35
In terms of what we are installing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:38
You know, back to some of the data and the statistics.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:42
The risk analysis is is common. I think.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:46
To what you're doing to you. We have our own model.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:51
We, we grade our pipes, we look at likelihood of failure. We look at consequence of failure.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:10:56
And then we have a map which you see on the right, and we cluster, projects together.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:01
We have break data back to the early 19 nineties.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:05
So we have a solid amount of of break data right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:11
That that goes into our model.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:14
One thing that we've started to look at more is, you know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:18
Yes, you select your project, you go replace your pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:21
But on an annual basis.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:24
What is the migration?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:27
Pipes from.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:29
You know a better grade to a a worse grade.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:32
So so how does that? You know we we have the Abcd system.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:37
How do those pipes in the A and B range.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:41
How quickly do they migrate, or what's the rate of migration.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:45
From that to the CD. And F range.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:50
And this migration is is something that we've. We've started to look at.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:53
You know right now I see 16 and 5 together, 21 miles.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:11:59
So right now our calculation. And this was a few years ago. Our calculation was that 21 miles is going to move into the Dnf category every year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:08
Well, if that's all we're replacing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:11
We're never going to get ahead.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:15
This number is being updated right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:19
But this is a key number to figure out. You know future staffing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:24
Plans, and where that long term replacement rate needs to be.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:28
Oh, this is this is a boring one! But we looked at workflows to try to identify different.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:37
Efficiencies in doing our work.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:40
Construction crew, staffing and contract work.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:44
All different things that we've looked at to be more cost effective.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:50
Here's materials.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:53
Crew staffing miles, you know, you know, digging in the in the ground.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:12:57
I noticed one of those pictures I saw earlier look like your pipe was in the off out of the right way, and the sidewalk. Maybe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:03
But all of our pipes are pretty much in the roadway.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:07
And so we gotta dig an open trench, and then you get a lot of the dirt.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:10
And you have to haul the dirt. So that's a big problem.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:14
In terms of minimizing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:16
That effort right there.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:21
Now here.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:23
Now we start looking at more hazard materials. So this is where Berkeley comes into play.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:30
This picture is the large scale fault, rupture, test, facility.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:34
Back at Cornell University. This was years ago.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:37
All the different pipe materials that have been tested like I said, our big challenge.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:42
Is is seismic landslide liquefaction. We want to put in the ground. That's gonna withstand all that ground movement.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:49
So we look to a lab for testing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:52
That's the large scale. Fault, rupture.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:55
Test.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:13:57
I'll skip this one for time's sake.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:03
I will skip this one, too, for time sakes, because we like to remain innovative. Here's the Berkeley Center for smart infrastructure.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:11
So a few years ago, we.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:14
Our general manager collaborated with Kinichioga, professor at Berkeley.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:20
To say.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:21
If we created this this collaboration between us, we can move that large scale rupture.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:28
From Cornell over to Berkeley.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:30
That was the big tipping point.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:33
The big catalyst for creating the smart infrastructure.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:37
So we've moved that over to Uc. Berkeley. And we've really created this kind of state of the art testing facility.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:46
To look at pipe tests.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:47
It's not. And it's not just about testing pipes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:51
But it's also about testing other technologies.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:55
That utilities can use.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:57
To increase their efficiencies and work.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:14:59
And solve their challenges.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:03
You know, condition assessment. Can we do some lab setup experiments with condition tools at the center.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:11
Is something that we're talking about.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:13
So here a few pictures from the lab.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:15
Here's a group of people outside the lab, and we're also teaching a class.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:20
We teach a class that's called Ce. 1, 2. It's called water and wastewater operations systems.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:27
And design, and we have about 30 students in the class this fall semester, and we go twice a week.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:32
To give lectures.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:34
On what we do here in East Bay, and then we have field trips to go out to our facilities.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:40
Oh, and we actually use this to recruit.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:44
students in into East Bay mud.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:47
So the collaboration between East Bay mud and Uc. Berkeley has been one of the best things that we've done.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:52
Really in the last 2 and a half years.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:54
And it gives us.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:57
Pathway, a connection.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:15:59
For staff at East Bay, mud.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:01
To work with Uc. Berkeley, professors.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:06
In their different fields.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:07
To do research to solve our challenging problems.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:12
And I know Kenichi, and maybe she hung will talk more about that later.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:16
This gives you a graph of of kind of what we've.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:21
Since 2,000 in terms of pipe replacement.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:24
So the blue is the replacement. We're up to 25 miles.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:29
Right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:30
This year we hit 25 miles. We're going up to 30.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:33
I'd like to see us go up to 40.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:37
It's there. I have moments when I think 40 miles, which is a 1% rate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:43
Still isn't enough.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:45
You look at the volume of our cast iron and asbestos pipe.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:50
And 40 miles per year, doesn't, you know? Get close to replacing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:16:55
The 2,000 plus miles that we have in our system of of just that. And that's not even considering the steel.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:03
That's just kind of waiting in the wings.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:06
And this is our break rate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:09
Roughly a thousand.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:11
1,000 main breaks per year.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:13
Right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:15
On average, 900 to a thousand. Somewhere in there.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:19
And we really want to bring that down to, you know, 5 to 600.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:24
If we could cut that in half. Really.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:26
I think our system would be.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:29
Qualified as much more healthy.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:32
Anyway, that's a quick summary.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:35
Of of what we're doing.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:38
With rebuild.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:17:41
I don't know if Michael, if you want to have a burning question, or we want to keep going.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:17:46
Well, yeah, I I thanks, David. That was really fantastic.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:17:52
Does anyone have a burning question? Do you want to add anything or.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:17:56
Yeah, just we. We've got some with with slowly going over the schedule. But I think any you know, really good conversation is always welcome.

[Fang Chen] 10:18:06
Not. Not a burning question is a comment. When we look at the water data in 30 40 s.

[Fang Chen] 10:18:13
Particularly in forties, is that it's also has a high break right.

[Fang Chen] 10:18:19
One of the reasons manufacturer. I think one of them is also the war factor.

[Fang Chen] 10:18:25
Is.

[Fang Chen] 10:18:26
The installation teams. All those ones make difference as well.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:18:27
Yes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:18:31
Absolutely, I totally agree.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:18:35
Just to. So that that was that was really great, and that's so great to see that it just illustrates the the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:18:42
License of your collaboration with Berkeley.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:45
Just a quick feedback. Michael.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:18:47
Yes.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:47
For us to discuss is that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:50
How the pipe was.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:52
Putting initially 30, 40, 50.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:55
6,000 years ago is unknown.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:18:58
You're not supposed to use the same.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:00
We don't know the fact. We have found.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:02
The same backfield.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:04
Has been used in some cases, whether it was properly compacted.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:08
So those are all unknown issues that we need to start thinking, how do we measure this.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:13
Now to say, these are.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:14
The environment around the pipe side. High risk.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:19:18
There's just a comment for thinking.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:19:20
I agree.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:22
I think, David, for me, like, you know, I haven't really got into the distribution pipes where we.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:30
Where, you know there's a lot of them for us is about 18,000 kilometers. And the cost! Oh, my God!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:38
So I think it would be good.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:39
For us to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:41
Chat offline of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:43
To identify some commonalities.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:45
And think about, as you said before, really really appreciated that that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:19:50
This one.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:19:51
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm totally open to that, too.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:19:54
So talking offline.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:19:57
Thanks, Simon David. Appreciate that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:19:59
I'll I might just at this point, hand over to Kenny.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:02
Yes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:20:03
And yeah.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:05
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:20:05
You've you've been very patient.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:06
Yeah, no, no, thanks up, Michael. And today I asked my colleagues.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:12
And also dyu who sort of led the project on using data analytics to look at pipeline degradation.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:19
And I see some commonality. So this is great. And then maybe we can discuss about that, as you can see, David, so we have other pipeline testing and everything. But I thought, this will be a focused one.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:31
That perhaps perhaps we can collaborate.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:33
So, Shawn, go ahead.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:20:42
Okay, so can you see my screen.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:20:48
Yes.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:20:48
Okay? So I think, yeah, if they were going to talk about the investigating the effects of pie properties and missing records, also model for water distribution systems. And I mean she hung a Phd. Student with Professor Soga.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:01
And I'm being working with value for on this project. And basically, we're collaborating with East Bay.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:09
So I think Debbie already mentioned about their service area, and, as you can see, there's a hey crossing this region, and then there's a lot of audio hazards happening.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:18
So I think the motivation for this study was, we want to know, how long would the pipeline last.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:24
How are they going to degrade and how to prioritize the pipeline projects? Basically.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:29
And we're being we're having collecting data and also using east data and trying to figure out a data treatment decision making way for pipeline repair and replacement.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:41
So just a brief background that they had that we collect. They would have a physical features, data, and operational parameters.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:47
From East Waymo, basically it has ageens material and breaks and much.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:53
Operational key perfor is probably like the operational pressure.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:21:57
In addition to those we also collect environmental factors like the soil type.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:02
Traffic allowed raw quality on ground water level, and so on and so forth from other open source databases.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:10
Like Usgs and the others.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:12
So I think the study we started with like how to model pipe, likelihood of failure, trying to understand the likelihood of the pipe.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:20
And I think, as David mentioned a lot of utilities, they may have their in-house model, which might be this kind of simplified, coefficient model that.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:30
You have some covariance that you believe that it might be influential for your pipeline degradation. Like the age materials number of 5 breaks for the past 5 years. For example.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:39
And based on your experience, then you might give them some coefficient, or the weight.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:45
For each of the covariates, and then you calculate the score, and based on this, you can

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:49
Kind of rank your pipe. And then, based on those 2 projects.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:53
And I think this is.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:55
Article, and easy.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:22:55
To use. But sometimes we might want to have a more robust.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:00
Understanding of what is really happening, utilize some statistical models.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:05
And in this study for now we're one of the focus is to use survival analysis, which is

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:11
So far I think the practice for.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:14
Other field like by engineering. They're estimating whether a drug is useful or not.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:18
For patients. So they are using this kind of survival analysis to understanding.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:23
Whether a factor or a drug is is good or bad, for a patient in our case will be for the pipe.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:31
And some example of why they use Cisco model, which is under the umbrella of survival analysis.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:36
For the pip. Likely a little failure will be the 1st will be the couple of parametric model that basically, we're trying to use historical data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:45
And trying to pop the curve, and the Y-axis will be the probability of survival.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:49
And X access will be the age, and trying to see as the pipe age, and how much I survive.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:23:58
At this age, and we'll go through this detail in detail in the following slide.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:02
And you see this.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:04
Plot here, basically trying to visualize our historical data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:07
But it's kind of a a step function is difficult to interpret. So we can also apply some parametric model like the way to some to make our curve smoother, so that I can.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:18
Make it easier for us to interpret.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:21
And not only just this, we also want to know.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:23
For example, maybe, how much a covariates or a variables that affect the response variable, which means.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:29
How much a variable will influence the pipe conditions that we can use this so-called regression model system model that can give out this kind of information which you will go through in detail later on, as well.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:42
And.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:43
The next one will be. I think it's an emerging techniques that a lot of machine learning model this is that they have driven model. But usually the difficulty will be, how do we interpret.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:24:54
Or understand or validate the protection results? Or did you trust this model? Basically because you offer often refers to as a black box model that you just input some parameters like the material age diameter. And you get the results like a pet condition implementing useful life by, you're not necessarily know about like, for example, here the newer network that how old those notes and ages are linked together, and how that behave.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:16
And that being said in this study, we.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:19
Focus a little bit more on the interpreter in terms of the prediction that we're trying to get so.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:26
I think we're focusing on the statistical models here. Mainly.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:29
So to start with, I talk about the survival analysis. So basically, just to quickly go through, how do the survival curve.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:37
Construct. So here, for example, we have 5 patients here, and we give them some treatment, or maybe a job.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:43
And at the year 0.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:45
All the people survive. So we have a hundred percent probability.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:49
But when it goes to the year 4, there's 1 person that. So the survivability drop to the percent to 80%.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:25:56
And the years of 6. Then another person, that soap ability becomes 60%.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:01
And so on, and so forth, until the year of 10. Then there's no pipe survive. So to sort of come 0.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:08
So basically, this is the concept of the Capler.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:12
My estimates that I mentioned before. That is basically trying to.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:16
Provide a graphical representation of the occurrence as a function of time. So basically, we can.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:22
Group our pi, our pipe into different categories, and then trying to see whether this.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:27
Covariate affect the variable curve.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:30
So.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:32
Click and plot. We can start off our data into different ways.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:36
And then trying to plug a survivor and trying to understand whether this covariates will affect the survival probability.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:43
So, for example, on the top left.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:46
We stratify our data into 2 groups. One is a date, is the pipe that is within the fall, and the other one is the pipe that are within the non photon. Basically.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:26:55
And you can see that the orange curve is always underneath the blue one, meaning that.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:03
The pipe that is within the fold on is more likely to fail compared to that. It's now within the fall.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:09
And we can stratify our data into.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:12
Multiple different group like whether it's in the lens or not. And very intuitively, if the privacy within the lens, then it's more likely to fail. Comparing to the others.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:20
And also we can look into different materials or different pipes, like the normal diameter of pipe, is more likely to fail compared to the large diameter pipe.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:29
Or per deliver level, that we know that maybe high level.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:33
Might influence the pipe. Degradation as well.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:36
And also I can see the big gap here the bottom left one, that if there is a leak in the past 5 years. Then it's much more likely.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:43
To fail, comparing to the ones without.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:46
And we can also sort of how they are depends on the different traffic load. The condition is so type.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:53
Etc.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:55
So this graph basically help us to trying to see of whether there.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:27:59
Effect of this covariate to our pipeline degradation.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:02
But we also don't know how much this covariate effect.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:07
The pipe degradation which the Cox

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:10
Cox model will help us to understand this later. This presentation.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:15
And not only just this.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:18
The nature of the pipe is a little bit more complicated, and just like a medicine to a patient, because once the patient but for the pipe is irreparable.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:26
So the pipe can fail, but we can repair it, and then still it is still in use.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:31
So actually, there will be like multiple time to events for a pipe life cycle.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:36
So this should be considered in this kind of analysis, as well.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:41
So the previous pause, that I show you we only consider the 1st failure as the failure. We're not considering all the 5 failure here.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:49
By this test, but this will eventually affect our result as well. So here, just example to quickly go through how this will affect the curve that we're getting.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:28:58
So here we can prepare that. I said, that we're only looking into the pipe that is installed after 1990, and also looking into the Federal Record says, only after 1990.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:09
And we're only looking into 2 type.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:11
Of material of the pipe that is now metallic, and also the.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:16
Steel material.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:18
So.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:20
If we consider so, here are the 2 plus. So.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:23
For the blue lines and the red line, the solid lines, one are the ones that we only consider 1st of the pipeline.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:30
And the bachelor ones are the ones that we consider all the better within this pipeline lifecycle. And you can see the shape of this curve here.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:38
So that if we consider more Federal here, you can see the curve basically shift downward.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:42
So that being said, it's like, when we're doing this kind of analysis, we also need to OP.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:50
Careful about what kind of feather, how we're defining.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:52
And how are we looking into this data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:55
The second nature of the pipeline data is that it's less truncated.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:29:59
Meaning, that.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:01
We start to install the pipe long time ago, but we did not have. We do not have the failure. Only after a certain point that being said, we're missing a lot of data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:10
Fader record data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:12
So the effect of this truncation issue will be, for example, in the Eastman day.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:18
As David mentioned. They started to build their pipelines.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:21
Earlier than 1880.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:23
Don't have much data before 1990. So basically, we only have the federal data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:23
But they're.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:29
So that being said, there's about like a hundred years of data that is missing.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:33
For their failure.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:36
So here, I just want to quickly show how this truncated better records influence the survival analysis as well.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:42
So here, that's used the same thing, I said again, so that we have.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:46
The pipeline that is, buried under the ground, like after 1,990.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:49
And we have the company records status of the order data that the Federal records after 90.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:30:56
And then we can manually trunk get our data. So we remove the 1st 5 year data for this data set. So we only have the data 95.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:04
We can remove the 1st 10 years. We only have data after 2,000.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:07
And we can remove the 1st 2 years as well.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:10
And then we can plot the survival curve for this data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:13
So we can see on the left, and also that is the number tags on the right of the steel pipes. And as you can see here that.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:21
The left truncation problem exists in old pipeline data set, and if there will result in the wrong survival time, it will ship the curve.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:29
So you can see that the top one is always the one that has the longest truncation time, and the bottom one is the one that is without the truncation.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:36
So the longer that our recorded historical time, the larger the shift.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:41
So.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:42
Basically the survivor analysis, although it's widely used in bi engineering, for example. But for when it comes to the pipeline degradation model.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:50
Then the problem will become.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:52
Because we have a truncated data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:53
So that the.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:31:55
Value of the survivability might not be accurate. But we can still use this method to compare different kind of coverage or effect to the pipeline survival.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:04
And then to accommodate this planning and working on, trying to use another approach to solve this issue, which will be the time between feather approach.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:12
Meaning that instead of looking into the.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:16
Historical

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:18
The missing data by, we're looking into the future records because there's a lot of research out there already mentioned that if there is a.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:24
Type.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:28
historical pipeline. This pipe, then it's more likely to. This pipe is more likely to fail. Comparing to the others that is.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:34
Has no historical records.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:37
So that being said, we're trying to estimate.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:41
Time between the next failure. So whether it's so we're looking into the future data instead of looking back to the.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:47
Missing records.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:49
So that's the thing that we're trying to.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:52
Estimate. Another question is that

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:32:54
We also want to know, not just about the likelihood of failure, but also want to trying to see what? To what extent does the covariate effect that, like a little failure of the pipes.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:03
So basically trying to identify the.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:06
Importance of the covariate.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:07
To the pipeline degradation.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:10
So the model here we're using is so called a cox proportional model that assumed the Hazaras proportion of the time.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:18
Where it is possible to estimate the contribution of covariance to pipeline likelihood. So basically just trying to figure out what is the most.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:25
Kind of influential factors that is influencing the appliance. And the good thing for this one is.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:32
We do not need to. It can adjust for multiple risk factors simultaneously and handle risk factors, meaning that we do not need to.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:40
Stratify our data. We just plug in the data in trying to see the effect of each covariates to the pipeline degradation.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:46
And they can help us to estimate a risk and also to manage complex data. So.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:33:52
Yeah. So here's the results. The left is the mathematical model which we're not going to dip into this one, but just want to look into the heads here.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:01
That hr here. How we interpret it is that if the Hr. Is close to.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:06
Once. That means there's like.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:08
No significant effect to the pipeline degradation. But if the has a ratio is less than one, that being said that it might help to reduce the hazard, and if the heads are ratio is greater than one, that means it might increase.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:21
that hazard.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:22
Basically.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:23
So if you look on the right results.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:25
Then well, we can interpret.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:28
In this way. So, for example, the 1st one the previous. So whether, if there is a previous failure, if the pipe with the previous leaks.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:36
That being said is degrading about 3 times faster than the ones we saw previously.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:42
And looking into the age. Attribute, then.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:44
Because it's really close to one that being said, H. Has more contribution to pipe degradation in our case.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:50
And if you're looking at the materials.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:52
The bottom one is still material, that that.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:34:55
That shows that, comparing to the espresso pipe, still pirates, about 56.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:01
Percent less likely to fail.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:02
So this is just how to interpret this kind of results.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:05
And I think I quickly went through a couple of things that we have been doing so far. So the key takeaways here that say, is.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:12
The 1st thing is this statistical analysis result should be interpreted.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:17
As especially less truncation. Issue is always.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:21
The problem that we have for the water pipeline system. The failure records.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:25
And also the repairable nature of pipeline system need to be carefully considered in the statistical models.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:31
So that we are trying to build up this time between method approach, trying to resolve this issue.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:37
And, lastly, is because of the nature of electronic data.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:41
The absolute Federal likelihood might not be accurate. However, the survival pattern.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:45
And the contribution of a covariate to the failure.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:49
Can still be estimated through this process.

[Shih-Hung Chiu] 10:35:53
So I think that's all. Thank you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:35:58
Thanks.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:35:59
See whom thanks so much.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:36:01
I might

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:36:04
Hand over to Kenichi. Did you wanna say anything further?

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:36:07
Before we enter the discussion.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:09
No, I I felt that the 2 presentation from the Sydney side and Berkeley side were very similar in a sense, and we look at in a different ways, and it was quite enlightening.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:21
To see looking at the same problem in a different way.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:23
And I think that's where we can learn each other.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:27
I I'm not sure, David, you have something I wanna say from.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:32
Data provider and any comments when you're working with Han. And then you actually, it was my, I was a Postdo Phd student of mine, and then postdoc, and then I'll move. Now move to Indonesia.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:44
As academic. So now he's with us. He's in the.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:48
Zoom Meeting, I think so that you can also maybe. Do you wanna say something.

[Dayu Apoji] 10:36:54
I know. I don't think I want to add something.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:36:59
Oh, okay.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:37:01
David.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:05
I you know some of that stuff at the very end she hung. I haven't seen before, so.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:09
That was that was fun.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:12
For for me to see so.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:14
I just I mean, just for for us to here.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:18
At East Bay mud getting to.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:19
Being able to work with, you know, someone like she hung and.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:24
And other graduate students.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:27
Has has been kind of a highlight of just the collaboration.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:31
Between the utility and the University.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:35
So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:36
It's it's been

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:38
And actually she hung, and I went to. We went to a conference together.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:42
This summer. Did a presentation together.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:46
At a Asce. Civil Engineering Pipelines Conference.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:51
So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:53
And we have plans for more. So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:55
Anyway, it's been. It's been very.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:37:57
It's been very enlightening and and fun to to work with with.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:38:03
Or the Berkeley. That's that's all.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:06
Thanks, David.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:08
Appreciate that, and and thanks Kenichi, and she hung. I wonder.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:12
With a.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:14
A thing.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:15
Sarath or Sanika. Do you have any.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:19
Questions.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:38:20
On the presentation from Shihan.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:23
Yeah, I have one.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:25
Again. I'm I'm you know, for the last 10 years I've been.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:29
Into this

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:31
Understanding, the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:33
Understanding the remaining live.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:36
So then we can. We can appropriately.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:39
I like it.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:41
Funds in a long term plan. That's.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:42
I must admit that's that's my.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:45
Focus, because you know, when.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:48
Over the 1015 years.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:50
You know, we we get restricted.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:52
To do a reactive renewal. So.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:55
It's a lot of complication. When we started we actively renew.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:38:59
And and also it's hard to get the budgets within next 2 to 3 year timeframe, unless you allocate for 10 years for the pricing and will impact and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:08
Number of things.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:09
So in terms of in in your

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:15
Analysis.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:15
Like, you know. Maybe David

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:18
You know. Have you like, you know, when you compare the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:22
Let's say, for example,

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:25
You know, used to call as a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:29
You know th, the the test, the accuracy.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:32
Like, for example.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:34
You you predict, or you forecast about, say, you know, 10 kilometer worth of assets going to fail in the next financial year.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:43
When the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:45
Based based on this. You know, prediction models.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:49
When they actually passed.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:50
Have you gone back and check.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:53
This is the 10 kilometer that you you marked.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:39:56
How many case we actually failed.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:40:02
To to really understand the accuracy of that prediction.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:40:07
You know you need a layman.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:09
You know, one thing we did send was

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:12
We did. We do have a machine learning model.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:17
For with a company called Fracta.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:20
In in the Us.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:21
We worked with them over the years to to help create the model.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:26
One thing we did was we.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:28
In creation of that model.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:30
Was, we gave them a set of data.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:32
But then we

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:35
Hid from them.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:37
The the future. The 4 or 5 years of data.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:40:40
Yes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:41
To estimate to see how accurate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:43
They were. So I maybe this is a common thing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:40:47
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:47
That that's done.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:48
So, and the prediction, the accuracy, prediction.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:54
Was.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:55
Was pretty good, 70 80%.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:40:58
Oh, that's good!

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:40:59
Maybe even better in some areas.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:02
Brilliant and.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:04
Our our problem. Our problem is that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:05
And I, yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:09
You know, when you look at our system, you have a lot of small little pieces.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:15
That are predicted to to fail in the next year. 5 years, that kind of thing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:18
Hmm.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:21
For us in construction. It's not cost effective to go. Do a little piss here, a little piece here, and a little piece here.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:25
Exactly.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:30
It's to, you know, if I'm gonna send a crew out to a job site, I want them to stay there for a while.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:35
That's that's when you really gain your efficiencies and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:39
Efficiency.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:39
You don't run, you don't run over your budgets.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:41:42
This.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:44
But.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:45
People have been saying to me, well, just go do a little bit here in a little bit here in a little bit here.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:52
But there's a lot of problems with that.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:41:55
In that, you know, paving restoration, you know, dealing with customers.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:00
Hey? I'm only gonna replace 1 3rd of the block. I'm not gonna go the whole way.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:05
A lot of other problems associated with that.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:09
But I think condition, assessment.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:12
If we had.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:14
We? We just don't have such a great condition. Assessment.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:19
Mo. Program yet.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:21
He already spay mud.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:23
And maybe that can be the the ultimate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:27
Missing piece. That kind of connects those 2 together.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:42:30
If that makes sense.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:33
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I totally agree. And same problem. And you know, at the moment we are doing some cluster.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:41
Nicole as cluster analysis for exact reason.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:46
Because when it goes to the delivery stage.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:48
We can't ask them to run around like hit list. We need to plan and rank the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:55
Their main replacement program with a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:42:57
With with the cluster, like, you know, valved, or in a particular area.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:02
Because otherwise it just cost.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:04
Delivery cost goes off.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:43:06
Yes.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:07
And then I think that's where the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:10
Us, now.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:12
I don't know. One is definitely distribution means. I really would like to.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:18
Pick your brains on what you were.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:20
And the second one is, how can we do the cluster analysis team.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:25
Improve the delivery, efficiency.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:28
Is another.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:30
But I really would like.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:32
To understand bit more in the distribution phase.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:43:36
Which, which we haven't. Yeah. We haven't really focused yet.

[Fang Chen] 10:43:42
Yeah, I may jump in

[Fang Chen] 10:43:45
To say

[Fang Chen] 10:43:47
A dummy car knows this well.

[Fang Chen] 10:43:51
I can't remember when, probably around 10 years ago.

[Fang Chen] 10:43:55
We actually did.

[Fang Chen] 10:43:57
Entire distribution, main.

[Fang Chen] 10:43:59
Analysis.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:00
And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that

[Fang Chen] 10:44:05
Accuracy.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:06
E is far better than the trunkman, because it has a lot of data.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:44:10
Because of the data.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:12
Yes.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:12
Also.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:14
We looked into zone based. So.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:17
I mean for the chunkmen we're looking to shut down. So basically

[Fang Chen] 10:44:23
Have the shut on zoom.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:25
As one of the factor to decide.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:27
You know, which parts you're going to pick up to do the condition assessment.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:33
For the smaller main and which is the distribution we're looking or help to design the prioritization program. We also looked into from operations, perspective.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:46
How to focus on. Hence you pick all those pipes, renewal or change whatever in that zone.

[Fang Chen] 10:44:54
That's number one. I mean, I'm more than happy. What is happy with more than happy to go back into some of the analysis we did in the past.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:05
That's number one. The second one is, I think, what we also did.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:11
Is looking at the.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:14
The cost effectiveness of the renewal program.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:19
So look into.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:22
Because a smaller man, you have a few.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:26
Sorry you when you have a break. So Shanghai was talking at 2 the.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:34
Sorry you have a several breaks for the smaller one. Maybe you started to do some significant replacement.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:42
And the break. The interval of each of them is getting short and shorter. So 1st one, maybe 1st and then yes, and then 12 month, or whatsoever.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:45:49
Hmm.

[Fang Chen] 10:45:54
So!

[Fang Chen] 10:45:56
At that time, for sitting water is looking into 40 years, some something.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:01
Like a economics, right? So if we do now.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:05
And if in next 40 years you have 10 braks, I'm just using any random number, and then.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:14
Probably this is worthwhile to replace earlier in the in the cycle rather than the cycle. We also embedded that economical model into that.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:24
And the last one I want to mention is.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:28
In the all the predictions we actually, I mean, I'm very happy to see some of the words say, Waybu, model Cox model all those ones we we touched on reevaluate as well.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:41
So is the end. We chose a known parametric model.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:47
For.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:49
A few reasons. Number one reason is how to build is more flexible.

[Fang Chen] 10:46:56
To to do that, for example, without a lot of assumptions. David's in your slides. One of them say, for example, the failure.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:08
The age.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:09
So 30 40 is very abnormal.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:13
So there's no

[Fang Chen] 10:47:17
Assumption of, for example.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:19
Age.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:20
More age, the pipes, the failure rate will be higher. Those assumptions, I mean, it's not a completely fit into all the predictions. Hence we try to chose some model which has the parameters is more.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:35
You can, flexible, construct it.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:38
And the second one in the.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:40
In trunkman we didn't use, but the reticulation means we use the some of the.

[Fang Chen] 10:47:47
How could say the stochastic process which is looking to more like how you predict the earthquake? So predict you have a several waves of the small crates, which is a some way relevant to multiple instance over breaks.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:04
So those ones may be helpful to look into.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:08
We're looking to the multiple instance on the same.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:13
And the last one.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:16
Ease.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:17
Moving, from.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:20
Statistics, which is the trend.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:23
And to exactly coho at the exactly pipe.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:27
That'll be. That is the biggest challenge. And that was the met. Most effort sort of like we put into is, we understand, a bit of distribution, and how we actually target on certain cohort, and how to define a certain cohort.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:46
To.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:47
The prediction has a higher certainty.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:49
Hence we came back to all.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:51
So when the when.

[Fang Chen] 10:48:53
The the certainty on certain cohort is not, you know, high enough, a trustworthy, and is very hard to take action into that.

[Fang Chen] 10:49:04
So I I mean sorry.

[Fang Chen] 10:49:06
There's a lot of throw ups. I mean, we're being.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:49:09
That was a lot.

[Fang Chen] 10:49:10
After so long, really passionate about.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:13
And.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:13
So there are 2 things. Yeah. Sorry.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:17
So there are 2 things that we're also working on, of course, about.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:21
Trying to be more specific about certain pipeline. Can we be more precision medicine like, so that David knows that this pipe.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:30
Can last for another 10 years or 5 years. So the planning for the replacement can be made. So that's something that Shawn is working with David. The second one is a little bit more.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:41
Because we're.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:43
In Bay Area. We have our earthquake.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:46
And when earthquake happens there'll be thousands of breaks.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:50
And how we going to fix that.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:53
In a sort of what we call functional recovery plan.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:49:56
Is also something that she is, and that you are working on.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:00
So that when something happens we don't know where it's gonna we sort of do simulation or we're likely to break. But the problem is that earthquake fault? Rupture may happen at different location, or has it.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:11
So. So therefore there's uncertainty there. So, having a little bit more understanding of.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:17
How to become a Functional Recovery.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:19
What is the plan for that.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:21
Is.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:22
East Bay mud has been very good at immediate recovery, so sort of temporary repair. But then it's really how to bring it back, for after.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:50:31
Big earthquake is something that we've been working on as well.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:37
Yeah, that's a that's a very interesting point, Kenichi, I think.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:40
The this the differences. That situation is reflecting what you're saying.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:46
The you know the the earthquake can.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:49
Well, firstly, do multiple breaks.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:52
All at once in very unpredictable places.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:50:56
I I mean, I'm not speaking on behalf of Sydney water rights. I would say we don't have.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:01
That here in in Australia, that type of situation, although we just had an earthquake the other day. 4. Something.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:08
Which is, I'm sure, nothing compared to what you have.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:12
So so send organic. What? What are your thoughts on that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:17
On the you know what I mean. There's some differences, you know, with the earthquake situation. But what about.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:23
We? If we come down to some similarities they're still paying mentioned, you know, some some elements there as well.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:51:31
Any thoughts from your side.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:51:34
I think for us. This is soil, type.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:51:36
Is the the closest like, you know, we we have some certain.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:51:42
Types as well. Like. I think, David, you mentioned some of the. Some of them are like near landslide areas and things like that, but we.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:51:50
Close for us is all time.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:51:51
And we are trying to understand the influence of this all type as well when we plan. I I think one of the thing where we need to improve is we have lot of

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:02
Lot of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:04
Make this as a bau.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:05
That's where I am like, you know. Yes, we've done lot of research and lot of.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:10
Data, good analysis.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:12
And.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:14
But we need to improve on. How can we make this as au to make.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:17
The next step.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:18
That's my current focus.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:21
Yeah, what are your thoughts on that? David and Kenichi?

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:26
Our our utilities that are now getting.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:30
Sort of itchy to actually have operational deployment of the research undertaken.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:36
What.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:52:37
Yeah. Good. Way to put.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:38
Is that on the horizon for you both David and.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:41
Can you see.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:52:44
Absolutely. Yeah, I mean,

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:52:48
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:52:50
Right now.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:52:51
You know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:52:52
Right, Kenichi.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:52:54
Yeah.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:52:55
Yes, I think that's what we're interested in. Make it happen.

[Kenichi Soga] 10:52:58
I think she has.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:52:59
What about?

[Kenichi Soga] 10:53:00
Got it. Sorry.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:53:00
What are the books? Are there any blockers for that from your perspective, or is it? Is it pretty much gonna happen.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:10
I mean, it's it's.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:12
You know it's and I and I think I don't know if it was sent or Domica that mentioned this earlier. But.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:19
You know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:21
If you have any kind of a change, innovation.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:24
Scaling that up and integrating it into a large organization.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:29
Can can even be kind of more challenging.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:32
But actually doing the innovation in itself, figuring out a solution.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:53:37
Exactly.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:37
So.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:39
You know, once Kenichi and Shih and the other graduate students come up with ideas and different ways for us to think about things and.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:49
Replace our pipes.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:50
We have to kind of integrate it into.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:53
How everybody else is doing things here too, and.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:56
Get everybody to buy in and agree and.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:53:59
And and this is a good way to do things.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:02
But overall, you know I I see there's only a few minutes left here.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:54:06
Yeah. Sorry.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:06
I I hear.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:08
I really hear like areas of collaboration. So I'm I'm thinking, future work together.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:54:14
Yep.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:14
I'm hearing. I mean, there's the modeling.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:18
You know, there's the there's the determining what to do in the future.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:22
How to spend your money.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:24
How to pick those projects the the most wise way.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:28
And then there's the condition assessment which we.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:31
Which we kind of touched on a little bit.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:34
But I kinda hear like those 3 areas.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:38
As as future.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:40
Future areas for us to collaborate.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 10:54:42
On!

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:54:46
It sounds great, David, what are your what are other people's thoughts? I mean, it's good that we.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:54:49
I'm glad we're coming to the point of those about. Say, we've been about 6 months left.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:54:55
I know, for our us colleagues, you know, dinner or something else, I'm sure.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:00
So yeah, what? What are your thoughts about those 3 areas? I mean, I'd I'd love to land on.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:05
Next, actions.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:06
So if I've read correctly from you, David, modeling.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:10
Determining what to do in the future, picking projects in a wise way. Money, constraints.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:14
And then 3rd condition, assessment. Any other thoughts.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:55:18
Model.

[Fang Chen] 10:55:18
I just want to jump on. It's I went completely. I just want to add on 1 point, which is a climate.

[Fang Chen] 10:55:25
So Sam mentioned that as well. So is it because of this climate change which has brings a lot of uncertainties. We don't know what our pipes of performance is going to be effective or not, or you. Which way.

[Fang Chen] 10:55:42
I know from perspective.

[Fang Chen] 10:55:45
Looking to rank for. So saying, we're saying the soil and soil is a very closely.

[Fang Chen] 10:55:51
Talked with a rain for all those weather. When the rain, a lot of rain gets into soil, you know. Get rain, and then attack the the pipes, corrosion, all those ones that become a ripple effect right.

[Fang Chen] 10:56:06
And then also I know when we did the analysis for other parts of the Australia, for example, Queensland, the drought has a significant influence towards the the pipe. Break right? All those one. So I'm just saying. And the global warming those ones no one actually even looking into but long term trained perspective.

[Fang Chen] 10:56:27
Is probably worth noting to put eyes on to that. See.

[Fang Chen] 10:56:32
What are the potential in influence.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:56:36
Yeah, I mean, that's a that's a really good one. Actually fang. And that fits in.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:56:40
If I may just boldly with the nau that has been signed between. I know I keep going back to this, but I am going to hit up.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:56:49
Wade Crow Foot, the Secretary for resources in.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:56:53
In your state to to sort of.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:56:56
Really get some movement. I've had some insight information to suggest that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:01
Any any sort of poc.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:03
Type projects that we could propose might actually be something that he.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:08
Would be supportive to have as an.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:11
Cause. No one wants to have an mu without any outcomes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:13
So, particularly if politicians are involved. So I've heard some good insiderance that we could make.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:19
Michael, 1. 1 important part is.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:21
I think it's quite important to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:25
We're all good at starting a collaboration and starting, you know, sharing information, both organizations. I don't think we'll object to that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:35
I think we need to define clearly what we're trying to achieve.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:57:38
Yep.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:39
If what we're trying to achieve is to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:43
Enhance the performance of our systems to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:46
Bring value to our customers. How do you measure that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:49
So Zen has started that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:51
Measurement.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:52
That measurement is based.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:55
What is capable of doing right now.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:57:57
But if we can bring these.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:00
Other.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:01
Innovations that we have brought into.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:04
That capability, we.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:06
What you are doing, and with what we have done.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:09
We can lift the current, you know capability rather than only talking about.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:15
What you have done, and what we have done.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:16
We can also improve the performance to our customers.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:19
So.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:20
That is an important thinking that we need to have.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:24
Eventually we need to say, okay, we started this collaboration.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:28
In 2 years, time.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:29
This is the enhancements. These are the questions we're asking.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:33
You have reviewed our performance? You have asked these questions, and we have been able to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:37
You know. Go through this and.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:40
You know. Review that, and come to a better.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:43
Proposition, so.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:44
Objectively positioning ourselves to enhance.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:48
Performance.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:50
With a baseline that you know.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:53
David has already started.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 10:58:54
Is very important.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:58:57
That is a very.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:58:59
Good point, I mean.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:00
It will probably, if we're focused on that, if and if we can agree on that, you know, as an overarching objective.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:07
At the end of that, you know. I'll speak for my uni.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:10
On this, you know, we're always looking at so societal benefit.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:14
Benefit industry benefit for government.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:18
And obviously.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:19
It that benefits people at the end. So that's the like we could, we could say, that's an overarching objective if we agree to that. And then what we can do is out of the 4 elements that we talked about, that David, and saying.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:30
Had outlined, we could say which one of those.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:33
Should we prioritize that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:35
Shift the needle.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:36
To that objective quicker.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:38
So that we did, yeah, we pick one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:40
And and just run with it. But we involve the 4 entities in in doing that. So what do people.

[Michael Blumenstein] 10:59:47
On looking in that way.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:59:49
Yeah, I agree. I agree with tamika as well, like. One of the challenge for us now is to get the momentum.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:59:57
We need to sell to people what's in it.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 10:59:59
What's in what?

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:00
You know what we need them for them.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:03
They. This is the reason that the for us within Sydney were exec and the board.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:09
The asset performance. Metric is one of the biggest.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:12
Because team so.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:13
If you can demonstrate by doing this, we're going to have a shift in this from this to this.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:18
Then we can get the momentum which which I can help.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:23
From Sydney Water, perspective.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:00:26
But yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:00:29
What are your thoughts, David and Kenichi? On on that.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:00:35
What do you think?

[Kenichi Soga] 11:00:38
Yeah, it's.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:00:40
Yeah, how do I? I think, David? Send. You know your customers.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:00:46
We're sort of a customer to our students, but also innovation, and then bring it to the to working with East Bay or working with Sydney water. So I think it's really, how do we tie those together?

[Kenichi Soga] 11:01:00
And maybe we have our own trick between.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:01:03
Our own universities and our local agency. How do that happen in international level? I think it's something that may be.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:01:11
You stay mud, and the Sydney water needs to think a little bit carefully.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:16
Yeah, it's.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:01:16
Of course, as a university we always collaborate.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:01:19
Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:20
Having that end value, that you know the value to our customers, the value to.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:26
Our rate. Pairs.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:29
You know, the collaboration is good and everything, and sharing data and doing presentations. But, like Domica said, I think,

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:36
You know, at the end of the day. It's it's about, you know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:40
Value and benefits.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:41
To the or you know.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:42
To, to, to, our.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:45
To the way we do our work and and to our customers. Eventually, you know, at the end.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:50
So we are. We're totally on. I'm I'm I'm on page.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:55
So you know, maybe that's piloting.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:01:59
You know different things, and then sharing information.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:02
Maybe it's sharing data.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:05
And.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:06
Different modeling techniques to improve our models together.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:11
That you.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:12
I think we need to identify like.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:15
Those things within the collaboration.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:17
That are going to.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:19
At the end of the day provide us that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:22
Yep.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:02:23
That that that value.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:25
Yeah, that's that's a good way to look at it. I mean, I think.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:28
So I think maybe I know that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:30
Sam and David, maybe, or Dumaka send David, or, you know, from a utilities point of view.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:36
Maybe I don't. I don't want to give homework.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:38
But I would, but I would love to say that we could. We could agree.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:42
Maybe you know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:44
As Kenichi mentioned. You know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:46
But universities just love to collaborate, but, and they always do.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:50
But in this international perspective of collaboration between utilities.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:54
Maybe between yourselves.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:02:57
You know, even having a brief conversation about what that would look like as an objective which might form.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:03
The the sort of priorities that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:06
Then the universities can come in on to support either the modeling of the data that's shared between the 2 organizations.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:14
Can you imagine, you know, a study, an international study on on X.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:18
That was had multiple sources of data from 2.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:22
Parts of the world, you know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:24
Proving something, or demonstrating some.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:27
Some real pathway to move that dial. I think it'd be a really.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:30
Really great.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:32
Quite objective.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:34
So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:34
So I don't know if I'm noticing. People have to drop off the call, and I thank you, Rafael. See you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:41
Look! We'll we'll we'll wind up in a minute. But I just want to say that the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:46
1 1 possibility. If David, sending Damica had a chat, you know, at some point to sort of look at that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:53
That sharing model, and or.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:57
Prioritization model and then.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:58
We could come back.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:03:59
To to have a talk about.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:02
That priority.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:03
In in in a you know, shorter form.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:07
To sort of hammer out the priority areas that we could collaborate on.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:10
Between university and utilities. Would that be one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:12
Action.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:04:14
Yes.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:04:15
I agree.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:04:15
I'm I'm yeah. I'm open to that. I also think that, you know, like she hung Shan and Fang could get together to talk about the.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:22
Yeah.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:04:22
Alright. That's right. Yeah.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:04:22
Alright!

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:24
Well.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:04:24
Separate, you know, in parallel right?

[Kenichi Soga] 11:04:25
As a separately. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:27
Buddy.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:27
Yeah, I said, I put that in my notes. Actually, there were 2 items modeling.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:31
So I was. I was saying, thanks, team, and Kenichi's team could have a chat.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:35
So I mean.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:36
We can't. We can't let Michael Salad get out of an action.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:41
No. No. Yeah.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:04:41
Yeah.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:41
So. No, so I'm just trying to.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:04:42
Interact.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:44
Yeah. Well, I'm trying to say that.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:46
When can Sara bring the in session tool to E.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:50
To the eastern part of.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:53
Us to demonstrate that it works.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:56
In critical water pipes. At this stage.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:04:58
There's other things we're doing around the distribution.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:02
Sara. Should you know, we at some stage, we need to start using this commercially.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:07
There's no point.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:08
Using any condition, assessment.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:11
Just within the universities and ourselves.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:13
We need to translate this to commercial environment.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:17
I think if you leave it like this without taking it to the high level through, send.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:22
In our organization.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:24
And our new head of business.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:26
We will have the.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:28
We can call the slow value of death.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:30
Of all these things.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:31
So.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:32
If you want to innovate and move forward.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:35
To add value. We need to start using these things.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:38
So using these things means.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:40
We need to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:42
Bring this to the highest part of the organizations. Get them committed? I don't think that's a problem.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:47
But the problem is in the middle part of the organization.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:50
And all these realignments restructures we do. They all say.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:54
We want to do everything which people like send and.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:58
Myself, and perhaps David.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:05:59
And you.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:00
The unities in us are possibly more collaborative.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:04
Then the new reorganized people.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:07
In these new organizations. So it is always a challenge. But if you focus on.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:12
Really a commercial environment.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:14
And I think Sara should start looking at some concept to.

[DNPHK5590F0X] 11:06:18
Work towards that.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:06:21
I think we can talk about that offline.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:22
No! That one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:24
Yeah, that would be amazing if if that could be one of the items that could be spoken about. Because I think.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:31
That that conversation around could the insertion come to the Us.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:06:35
Hmm.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:35
To demonstrate for David some element in Itman.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:39
It would need agreement, I suppose, from David's side.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:42
But if if that is part of the conversation that you have.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:46
You know between.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:48
David and and Domica. That would be good.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:50
So I don't want to let.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:52
Take off without having an action. It's predominantly.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:06:57
But it. Why not look at some conversations in parallel.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:02
So what would people think? We've got these conversations? I might send out a couple of dot points.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:07
As notes that I've been taking.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:08
In the conversation.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:11
And as I said, I don't want to be the person that gives actions. Because that means I'm trying to give work to people. But.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:16
I I do think that it's there's some. There's some synergies.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:19
And I think that's what what would people think if we came back.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:23
After those conversations took place for another, one of these sessions.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:27
Maybe a shorter focused one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:29
You know, to to sort of see how we each fared on the conversations we've had.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:33
Would that be amenable at any time before the end of the year?

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:37
Or is that too soon?

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:07:41
That works for me.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:43
Panicia about you.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:07:44
Yes, yes.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:07:45
Think so. I think it's keep on talking. You've been really good, so let's keep on going.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:50
Yeah, sorry I've I've thought too much, actually. But but I think I just wanna, I'm just excited about this. And and I just wanna ensure we've got some.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:07:59
Clear ways in which we can work together. And I think we're coming down to that.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:03
Pointy end where we can.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:04
But it needs conversations.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:05
And and.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:08
And Michael, just to let you know that we are in a we are in at the moment. We're in a 5 year pricing.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:14
And like.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:16
Really hectic. That's.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:18
The I think the date is set for 1st of December, like 1st week of December, we're getting audited. So it's a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:24
It's a time that you know I have.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:27
You know, 1,000 emails which unread emails in my inbox? So it's, I, I think, for my.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:30
Oh!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:34
Perspective. It's going to be hectic.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:38
Before that 1st week of December.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:39
To get myself

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:43
Focus on this one.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:44
Okay.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:46
That's a challenge. But I need to prioritize the.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:08:49
Pricing works.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:51
No, I understand entirely, understandally.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:54
Well, we could do this.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:08:56
We could still do something. My suggestion is before December.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:00
But maybe the the modeling.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:02
You know the the actions may be on Fang and Kenichi's teams.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:06
And surf.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:08
You know. Maybe if that there's time for those conversations to occur, we come back before December. I just don't want to lose momentum.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:14
And maybe we we.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:16
Yeah, we can have a discussion like here and there. We can have a discussion. But for, like you know, I'm happy to meet before, like, you know, end of October time period with David and Domica myself.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:25
Yep.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:26
Have, a.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:27
Bit more in depth, in depth, discussion. What? What the value we are going to get out of it.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:29
Go ahead!

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:31
And by mid, you know, I would prefer.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:35
You know, been very clear from, say, mid November to 1st week of December.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:42
It's really.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:43
To get the

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:45
Submission through.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:47
So that in November to end of November is not.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:47
Okay.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:09:52
Easy for you, basically, okay.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:53
No. Mid mid November to the 1st week of December. If if we are thinking about.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:09:59
End of decem like, you know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:00
Yeah.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:00
Before the end of the year discussion.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:02
Happy. After 1st week of December.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:05
But.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:07
Getting into the holiday season as well. So I'm I'm heavy.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:09
Yeah.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:09
That's the problem. I think I think we will have a challenge from December onwards.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:13
This.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:15
Nice.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:16
So my my suggestion is

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:18
If we have something.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:20
To bring back to the table from at least one of the teams, you know. Maybe the university.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:26
Let's bring it back before the end of November.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:10:29
Okay.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:29
Right.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:30
But.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:31
If any, and and I might put a call out and just say, how are those conversations? You know Fang and Kenichi's team.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:38
Going.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:39
For for an individual, and let's just put a date in. If we if we meet, we meet, if we don't, we don't. But let's just put a date in.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:44
And we can just have something before the end of November.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:48
But if we really need to have a proper one where you've already got your.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:52
Here, free a little bit same away from this pricing aspect.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:10:56
We could. We could do early next year instead, you know. So I'm just feeling that December is not.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:01
Not gonna work mainly because I.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:04
Gonna go away, and I'm sure other.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:07
Will be 2. It started getting a bit hairy.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:10
So maybe end of November for touch.

[Sen Vigneswaran] 11:11:13
Yep.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:13
Focused.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:14
1Â h.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:16
And and I'll I'll send through some day options to see what people think.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:11:20
Sounds good.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:21
And and then we can take.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:22
You know, the more pointy end in the 1st quarter of next year.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:28
By the way, I'm taking my holidays this year in.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:30
In the United States. So just so you're aware.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:34
I'll be. I'll be in la believe it or not. Between December 13th and Christmas.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:38
So if you know.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:40
You never know might see. You can eat you.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:11:43
If.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:45
If any one of you.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:11:46
Happens to go to Disneyland. Fan. Yes.

[Fang Chen] 11:11:48
Just jump in. I'm more than happy to organize a separate chat with the kitchen, very intrigued.

[Fang Chen] 11:11:57
You know I mean.

[Fang Chen] 11:11:59
From university collaboration perspective. Even we aim some joint publication that will be that will be useful.

[Fang Chen] 11:12:06
And on top of that is we also run smart infrastructure teams. Here.

[Fang Chen] 11:12:12
Which is a as as a you introduced earlier beyond the water, we actually do transport. We do other key infrastructure as well. For example, the telecommunications.

[Fang Chen] 11:12:23
So it's a plenty of other things we could. You know.

[Fang Chen] 11:12:30
Explore collaboration, just separately.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:12:32
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Frank.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:12:33
Yeah, thanks. David and Kenji, it is very nice to meet you. This is the 1st time I was meeting, but feel free to contact me at any time. We can have a chat.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:12:44
If there is any potential of you know talking about condition, assessment.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:12:48
How it could be integrated with the modeling that you're doing or.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:12:52
You know, it could be a part of the modeling process where I, the condition assessment continuously.

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:12:58
Give feedback to improve the modeling right? So there are lot of opportunities there. Please feel free to

[Sarath Kodagoda] 11:13:05
Contact. I just send the Linkedin invite to both of you. So we go from there.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:13:11
Yeah, likewise for me, in terms of reaching out. So.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:13:11
Yeah, thank, you.

[David Katzev, EBMUD] 11:13:16
I probably need to run.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:17
Yeah, look I, I can change any last words before we go.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:13:21
Now. Michael, thank you very much. You are the driving force, and I really appreciate, and I'm sure everybody.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:28
Yeah, look, thank you. All appreciate your time. I'm gonna send out a couple of notes and a couple of actions.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:34
If the teams can chat between time.

[Kenichi Soga] 11:13:37
Yes.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:37
We will get something figured out for him before the end of November, just to touch base. So.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:43
A man full of your time. We're over 15Â min nearly.

[Michael Blumenstein] 11:13:45
Have a great evening, Kenichi and David. Thank you. Have a great day. Everyone on the Australian side.
